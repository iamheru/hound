# Hound
Hound is a light, flat-file, PHP-based content management system.

# Version
Current version: `0.1.1`

Note that versions below 1.0 are considered alpha and not production-ready. I am adding breaking features and changing page loading behaviour.

# Upgrading
When upgrading your Hound site, just replace (and overwrite) all files except for site-specific content (see below).

**Do not remove or replace the following files and folders:**

```
/files/
/site/
.htaccess
config.php
```
